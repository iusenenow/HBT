            I come here when I need time to plan and dream. The rooms are very
            spacious and inviting. The Black Hotel is excellent and the service
            is great. Enjoyed the facilities, large rooms, comfy beds, yummy
            breakfast. Staff were efficient, helpful polite and patient. Garden
            area was spacious and a lovely area for cocktail function. Good
            range of drinks available too.

            My husband and I recently stayed at The Black Hotel for several
            weeks with our two young children and we were so happy with the
            service we received and the quality of the hotel. The staff were so
            helpful and friendly! Their catering and hospitality are exceptional
            and will not let you down. the staff were successfully able to cater
            to any dietary.
